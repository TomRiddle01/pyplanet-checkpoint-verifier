# pyplanet-checkpoint-verifier


This is a plugin for [PyPlanet](https://github.com/PyPlanet/PyPlanet/).

This plugin currently does two things:

1. Record the locations of driven checkpoints in order.
2. Verify if the recorded locations match the recorded order of other players (and displays a warning if it doesn't).


The first will be moved to a different plugin in the future because other plugins depend on this feature too.
